## Description

Pomodoro timer incorporating regular short exercise breaks based on stored user profile

## Motivation

Just like most good things in life, little and often works best. So, lets take regular breaks with some regular exercise. For motivation lets set daily goals on exercises of our choices and work on building strong bodies and a focussed work day.

Personally, I am making this to work on my first full-stack application. I am studiying the Free Code Camp course and currently working on the back-end portion. I will be working on this concurrently, aiming to start work on the back-end once I have finished the relevent course.

I will be using the MERN stack, MongoDb/Mongoose, Express, React (with Material UI), Node.js
I aim to deploy using Heroku.
To further my professional development I will be using a kanban on Trello.
I will also look at suing Figma for the initial design to familiarize myself with design tools and methodoly.
