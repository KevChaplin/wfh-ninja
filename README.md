## Description

Pomodoro timer incorporating regular short exercise breaks based on stored user profile.

## Outline

Increase productivity by setting a regular work/break timer to pace your day. Don't stop there, set your workout goals for the day, then complete a portion of your daily goals at the start of each short break and before you know it, over the course of the day you have completed your work and your work-out goals.

## Motivation

Coming from being a professional Karate instructor, working out for several hours every day, to suddenly house-bound due to the pandemic, taking care of my two young daughters and spending all my free time at my PC studying. My fitness has taken a big hit. I figured I need a way to fix the situation while keeping up my study routine.

For my professional development, I am making this to build my first full-stack application. I am studiying the Free Code Camp course and have completed both the Front-end and Back-end certifications. I hope to solidify my knowledge using this personal project.

## Methodology

I will be using the MERN stack, MongoDb/Mongoose, Express, React (with Material UI), Node.js  
I aim to deploy using Heroku.  
To further my professional skills I will be using a kanban on Trello.

## Thanks to

Thanks to Coding Addict whose fantastic Node, Express, MongoDb, Mongoose course taught me so much about the Back-end. I have used his Jobs API project for the basis of this project's Back-end.
